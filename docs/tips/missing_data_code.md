## _"Missing Data, Oh it can be a pain"_

Handling missing values after data collection is seen as a common task in data cleaning and data processing pre-analysis.

We don't want to report/infer inaccurate insights from our collected data so this is a very important step to take. Luckily REDCap prospectively allows us to consider missing values during the data collection component of a project. Within REDCap we have the control to specify and add context to missing values by stating the reason behind a missing value. This helps our future selfs and results in a more reliable dataset for analysis.

More information can be found in the following link below via REDCap.
