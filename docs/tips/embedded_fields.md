# Embedded Fields
{: .no_toc }

New
{: .label .label-yellow }

This new feature will allow you to customize your surveys and data collection instruments to make them look exactly how you want by 
allowing you to reposition field elements on a survey page or data entry form so that they get embedded in a new location on that same page.

It opens up so much opportunity to layout/format your forms and surveys that had been restricted in past versions of REDCap.

It allows you to stack groups of related field elements together as opposed to the traditional linear layout that REDCap provided in the past.
