# Support

Support provided includes design and build of projects within REDCap and utilising all of the available in-built functions that REDCap provides. This is often achieved through “thoughtful thinking” and planning of the project through early engagement with project leads and team members to set out project requirements and identifying whether REDCap is the right tool for the scope of work.

Data management is also provided with guidance on “Best Practices” and “SOPs” that help with this task throughout a projects lifecycle.
