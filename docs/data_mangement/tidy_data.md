Tidying data is a key component of data cleaning and results in easy data manipulation, modeling, visualisation and subsequent analysis. A key principle of tidy data is that it provides a standard way to organise data values within a dataset. This standard approach allows us to link the structure (physical layout) of a dataset with its semantics (meaning).

Tidy data is well suited for vectorized programming languages like R, STATA, Python because the layout ensures that values for different variables from the same observation are always paired correctly. It is important to consider that most real world datsets are not tidy and that this step of data tidying is needed regardless of the method used for data collection.

REDCap allows us to collect our data in a standard way (preknown structure) which then allows us to use our tools for data tidying in an automated way, as we expect the input (REDCap extract) in a particular format. This results in a seamless transition between the data collection and data analysis phase of a project.
